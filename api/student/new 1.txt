
I Have Built REST API using PHP and MySQL database

I have depiced CRUD features using REST API's

4 API endpoints have been built with which you can
	
	1. Insert data
	2. retrieve data
	3. update data
	4. delete data

3 such sets of API's have been built for a school Database
	Set 1: Student table
	Set 2: Teacher table
	Set 3: Subject table
	
I've used POSTMAN to test API

Just as CRUD features are shown for Student, Similarly the API can be tested for Teacher and Subject table also.

ThankYou..!!
